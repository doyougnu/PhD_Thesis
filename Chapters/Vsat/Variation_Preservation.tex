We have formalized variational satisfiability solving. In this section we prove
that our method is variation preserving. Variation preserving is a key property
for variational or variation-aware systems. A system is variation preserving if
and only if processing the variational artifact produces a variational result
which upon configuration recovers semantically identical plain results for each
variant. This statement is summarized in the commuting diagram shown in
\autoref{vsat:commuting-diagram}.
