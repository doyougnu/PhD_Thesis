We have formalized variational satisfiability solving. In this section we prove
that our method is variation preserving. Variation preserving is a key property
for variational or variation-aware systems. A system is variation preserving if
and only if processing the variational artifact produces a variational result
which upon configuration recovers semantically identical plain results for each
variant.

The property of variation preservation is summarized in
\autoref{vsat:commuting-diagram}. The commuting diagram states that both paths
in the diagram should be equivalent. That is, for any \ac{vpl} formula $\kf{f}$,
if we configure $\kf{f}$ to find all possible variants, and then run a plain
\ac{sat} solver on each variant, then we should find the same number of \ac{sat}
results if we run the variational solver on \ac{f} and find all variants of the
variational model.
