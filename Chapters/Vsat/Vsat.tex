\label{chapter:vsat}

This chapter presents the variational satisfiability solving algorithm as a
compiler. First we present a general overview of the solving algorithm in
\autoref{section:vsat:approach}. \autoref{section:vsat:approach} describes the
algorithm in terms of communication between four subsystems, introduces the
concept of \emph{variational cores}, and the intermediate language that each
subsystem operates on. Each of these subsystems process the intermediate
representation in a combination of phases which are covered in detail in the
following sections, including examples of the compiled \acl{smtlib} output. We
conclude the chapter with \autoref{section:vsat:formalization}.
\autoref{section:vsat:formalization} presents inference rules to specify the
behavior of an abstract variational satisfiability solver by formalizing the
interplay between these phases, and thus the interplay between the subsystems.
