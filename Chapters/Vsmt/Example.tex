With variational \ac{smt} solving formally specified. We present a complete
example of solving a variational \ac{smt} problem. Consider the query formula
\newline$\kf{\hV = ((1 + 2 < (i - \chc[A]{k,l})) \wedge a) \wedge
  (\chc[B]{c,\neg b} \vee b)}$ with two choices parameterized by the dimensions
$A$ and $B$. Derivation of the variational core for $\kf{h}$ begins with all
evaluation and all stores \aStore{}, \eStore{} initialized to $\emptyset$.

The root of \hV{} is $\wedge$ and thus \evAnd{} is the only applicable rule.
From \evAnd{} we have $\eIL*{1} = \kf{((1 + 2 < (i - \chc[A]{k,l})) \wedge a)}$,
and $\eIL*{2} = (\chc[B]{c,\neg b} \vee b)$. We traverse \eIL*{1} first, leading
to a recursive application of \evAnd{}. We denote recursive levels with a tick
mark: $'$, thus $\kf{\eIL*{1}' = (1 + 2 < (i - \chc[A]{k,l}))}$ is the left
child of \eIL*{1}, with $\kf{\eIL*{2}' = a}$ as the right child.

The root of $\eIL*{1}'$ is an inequality, so the only way to progress is to try
to accumulate $\eIL*{1}'$. The accumulation will succeed; in accumulation, only
\acInEqV{} can apply as accumulation will be unable to transform the right child
of $\eIL*{1}'$ to a symbolic value due to the presence of a choice. \acInEqV{}
will further destruct $\eIL*{1}'$ to $\eAR*{1} = 1 + 2$ and $\eAR*{2} = i -
\chc[A]{k,l}$. $\eAR*{1}$ will be accumulated to a single symbolic value by
application of \acArithS{} and \acRef{} on the literals $1$ and $2$ yielding
$\eAR*{1} = s_{12}$, with store $\aStore{}=\set{(s_{1} + s_{2}, s_{12}),
  (2,s_{2}), (1,s_{1})}$.

Using the resultant store from accumulating $\eAR*{1}$, accumulation on
$\eAR*{2}$ will yield the term $s_{i} - \chc[A]{k,l}$. The variable $i$ will be
accumulated to a symbolic value with \acRef{} and the choice will be passed over
by \acChc{}. Thus we have the accumulated result for $\eIL*{1}'$ as the
intermediate term $\eIL*{1}_{acc} = s_{12} < (s_{i} - \chc[A]{k,l})$ with store
$\aStore{}=\set{(i, s_{i}),(s_{1} + s_{2}, s_{12}), (2,s_{2}), (1,s_{1})}$.

With the left child of $\eIL*{1}'$ accumulated, \evAnd{} attempts to continue
evaluation on the right child and will succeed. Notice that this is a special
case as the root of \eIL*{1} is $\wedge$ and so is the root of \hV{}. Thus,
$\eIL*{2}$ will transform $a$ to a symbolic value through accumulation using the
previous store and assert the symbolic value in the base solver with \evSym{}.
The resulting intermediate term will be $s_{12} < (s_{i} - \chc[A]{k,l}) \wedge
\unit{}$, with stores $\eStore{}=\set{s_{a}}$, $\aStore{}=\set{(a,s_{a}),(i,
  s_{i}),(s_{1} + s_{2}, s_{12}), (2,s_{2}), (1,s_{1})}$ and will be reduce to
the final intermediate result $\eIL*{1}_{core} = s_{12} < (s_{i} -
\chc[A]{k,l})$ with the same stores via application of \evAndR{}.

We have now returned back to the top level call to \evAnd{} with a result for
the left child and populated stores. Evaluation will proceed on the right child
$\eIL*{2}$. \eIL*{2}'s root is a disjunction, and thus to proceed evaluation
switched to accumulation by applying \evAcc{}. The accumulation is
straightforward; the left child is the choice $\chc[B]{c, \neg b}$ and is
returned by \acChc{}. The right child is a single variable, and thus is
translated to the symbolic value $s_{b}$. Thus we have the final result for
$\eIL*{2}$, $\eIL*{2}_{core} = \chc[B]{c,\neg b} \vee{} s_{b}$ and the
variational core of \hV{}, $\hV{}_{core} = s_{12} < (s_{i} - \chc[A]{k,l})
\wedge{} (\chc[B]{c,\neg b} \vee{} s_{b})$ with stores $\eStore{}=\set{s_{a}}$,
$\aStore{}=\set{(b, s_{b}),(a,s_{a}),(i, s_{i}),(s_{1} + s_{2}, s_{12}),
  (2,s_{2}), (1,s_{1})}$.

With the variational core derived we can begin choice removal. We assume an
empty configuration for the remainder of the example. The exact semantics of a
\vc{} is implementation specific. For example, our prototype variational
\ac{sat} solver pre-populates the configuration with a generated configuration
based on the user \vc{}. In contrast, the prototype variational \ac{smt} solver
checks the dimensions assignments of \true{} or \false{} in \crChc{} are valid
with respect to the \vc{}, if not then the variant is skipped.

Choice removal begins with the variational core in the focus and an evaluation
context \zipper{} = \inRoot{}, because $\hV_{core}$'s root is $\wedge$ only
\crBool{} applies moving $s_{12} < (s_{i} - \chc[A]{k,l})$ into the focus and
storing the right child in the context: $\zipper =
\inBoolL*{\inRoot{}}{(\chc[B]{c,\neg b} \vee{} s_{b})}{\wedge}$. With $s_{12} <
(s_{i} - \chc[A]{k,l})$ as the focus, the only applicable rule is \crInEq{} due
to $<$ at the root of the focus. \crInEq{} again recurs left, focusing on the
sub-term $s_{12}$ with context $\zipper =
\inInEqL*{\inBoolL*{\inRoot{}}{(\chc[B]{c,\neg b} \vee{} s_{b})}{\wedge}}{(s_{i}
  - \chc[A]{k,l})}{<}$ which states that $s_{12}$ exists in the left child of an
inequality which also exists in the left child of a conjunction.

We have arrived at the base case with a symbolic value is in focus, and the
immediate parent in the evaluation context is an inequality. To proceed we need
to \emph{switch} to begin processing the right child of the inequality; thus we
must apply \crInEqL{}. \crInEqL{} swaps the symbolic with the un-processed right
child held in the context, hence we have $(s_{i} - \chc[A]{k,l})$ in focus with
context $\zipper = \inInEqR*{s_{12}}{\inBoolL*{\inRoot{}}{(\chc[B]{c,\neg b}
    \vee{} s_{b})}{\wedge}}{<}$. $-$ is a previously unseen relation, when an
new relation is found choice removal will recur into the left child. In this
case $- \in \integerFuncs{}$ and so \crArith{} applies. \crArith{} moves $s_{i}$
into the focus and extend the evaluation context to $\zipper =
\inArithL*{\inInEqR*{s_{12}}{\inBoolL*{\inRoot{}}{(\chc[B]{c,\neg b} \vee{}
      s_{b})}{\wedge}}{<}}{\chc[A]{k,l}}{-}$.

With $s_{i}$ in the focus we've arrived at another base case, only this time when
the switch occurs a choice will be in focus. The switch is performed by
\crArithL{} and yields $\chc[A]{k, l}$ as the focus with context $\zipper =
\inArithR*{s_{i}}{\inInEqR*{s_{12}}{\inBoolL*{\inRoot{}}{(\chc[B]{c,\neg b}
      \vee{} s_{b})}{\wedge}}{<}}{-}$. Now we the heart of choice removal
applies, because we have $\configuration{} = \emptyset$, the only applicable
rule with a choice in the focus is \crChc. \crChc{} creates two recursive calls,
one for each alternative using \emph{the same context}, thus we'll have
$\configuration= \set{(A,\true)}$, with focus $k$, and context $\zipper =
\inArithR*{s_{i}}{\inInEqR*{s_{12}}{\inBoolL*{\inRoot{}}{(\chc[B]{c,\neg b}
      \vee{} s_{b})}{\wedge}}{<}}{-}$.

For the remainder of the example we'll continue with only true alternatives; the
other variants follow similar paths. \todo{make sure this isn't a type
  error}Accumulation is called on the introduced plain terms, converting $k$ to
$s_{k}$ and extending the accumulation store to
\newline$\aStore{}=\set{(k,s_{k}),(b, s_{b}),(a,s_{a}),(i, s_{i}),(s_{1} +
  s_{2}, s_{12}), (2,s_{2}), (1,s_{1})}$.

With a symbolic value in the focus, and with the context already switched to the
right child we have come to a sequence of base cases which perform the folds, in
this case \crArithR{} applies. \crArithR{} calls accumulation on $s_{i} -
s_{k}$. $s_{i} - s_{k}$ has not yet been observed in accumulation and thus the
new symbolic value $s_{ik}$ will be generated. This yields $s_{ik}$ in the
focus, with $\aStore{}=\set{(s_{i} - s_{k}, s_{ik}), (k,s_{k}),(b,
  s_{b}),(a,s_{a}),(i, s_{i}),(s_{1} + s_{2}, s_{12}), (2,s_{2}), (1,s_{1})}$,
and $\zipper = \inInEqR*{s_{12}}{\inBoolL*{\inRoot{}}{(\chc[B]{c,\neg b} \vee{}
    s_{b})}{\wedge}}{<}$.

With $s_{ik}$ in the focus we have yet another base case which consumes some
context, only this time we consume the inequality using \crInEqR{}. \crInEqR{}
calls accumulation on $s_{12} < s_{ik}$, similar to the previous call over $-$
this call produces a new symbolic value and extends the accumulation store.
Hence, we'll have $s_{12ik}$ in the focus, with $\aStore{}=\set{(s_{12} <
  s_{ik}, s_{12ik}),(s_{i} - s_{k}, s_{ik}), (k,s_{k}),(b, s_{b}),(a,s_{a}),(i,
  s_{i}),(s_{1} + s_{2}, s_{12}), (2,s_{2}), (1,s_{1})}$, and $\zipper =
\inBoolL*{\inRoot{}}{(\chc[B]{c,\neg b} \vee{} s_{b})}{\wedge}$ as the
evaluation context. With a symbolic value in the focus, and a context indicating
the left child of a relation, choice removal switches to process the right
alternative. The relation in this case is $\wedge$ and so \crBoolL{} applies to
execute the switch yielding $\chc[B]{c,\neg b} \vee{} s_{b}$ in the focus, and
$\zipper = \inBoolR*{s_{12ik}}{\inRoot{}}{\wedge}$. $\vee$ is a relation that is
previously unseen, and thus \crBool{} recurs into its left child yielding the
choice $\chc[B]{c, \neg b}$ in the focus and \newline$\zipper =
\inBoolL*{\inBoolR*{s_{12ik}}{\inRoot{}}{\wedge}}{s_{b}}{\vee}$ as the context.

We have arrived at the second choice. $B \notin \dom{C}$ and thus only \crChc
applies. Following the true alternative for $B$, accumulation is called on $c$
yielding $s_{c}$ in the focus, with $\configuration = \set{(B,\true),
  (A,\true)}$, $\aStore{}=\{(c,s_{c}),(s_{12} < s_{ik}, s_{12ik}),(s_{i} -
s_{k}, s_{ik}),(k,s_{k})$ $ ,(b, s_{b}), (a,s_{a}),(i, s_{i}),(s_{1} + s_{2},
s_{12}), (2,s_{2}), (1,s_{1})\}$, and $\zipper =
\inBoolL*{\inBoolR*{s_{12ik}}{\inRoot{}}{\wedge}}{s_{b}}{\vee}$. All that is
left is a switch and then to complete the fold with the symbolic values.
\crBoolL{} switches the context placing $s_{b}$ in the focus and yielding
$\zipper = \inBoolR*{s_{c}}{\inBoolR*{s_{12ik}}{\inRoot{}}{\wedge}}{\vee}$,
which will be followed by \crBoolR{} to disjunct $s_{c}$ and $s_{b}$ using
accumulation. The resulting term will have $s_{bc}$ in the focus,
$\aStore{}=\{(s_{c} \vee s_{b}, s_{cb}),(c,s_{c}),(s_{12} < s_{ik},
s_{12ik}),(s_{i} - s_{k}, s_{ik}),(k,s_{k})$ $ ,(b, s_{b}), (a,s_{a}),(i,
s_{i}),(s_{1} + s_{2}, s_{12}), (2,s_{2}), (1,s_{1})\}$, and $\zipper =
\inBoolR*{s_{12ik}}{\inRoot{}}{\wedge}$, which leaves only one more reduction
until model generation. \crBoolR{} applies again to conjunct the last two
symbolic values, yielding $\zipper = \inRoot{}$, $s_{12ikbc}$ in the focus and
$\aStore{}=\{(s_{12ik} \wedge s_{bc}, s_{12ikbc}), (s_{c} \vee s_{b},
s_{cb}),(c,s_{c}),(s_{12} < s_{ik}, s_{12ik}),(s_{i} - s_{k}, s_{ik}),(k,s_{k})$
$ ,(b, s_{b}), (a,s_{a}),(i, s_{i}),(s_{1} + s_{2}, s_{12}), (2,s_{2}),
(1,s_{1})\}$.

Thus we have reached the variant parameterized by
$\configuration=\set{(B,\true),(A,\true)}$ \crEval{} applies due to $\zipper =
\inRoot{}$ and the symbolic value in the focus, \evSym{} will yields \unit{}
with $\zipper = \inRoot{}$, indicating that it is safe to query a model for this
variant from the base solver. Due to the two application of \crChc three other
variants will be found during back tracking beginning with the dimension used in
the most recent application. In this case that is the dimension $B$, and thus
the next variant that will be found is parameterized by
$\configuration=\set{(B,\false),(A, \true)}$ with context $\zipper =
\inBoolL*{\inBoolR*{s_{12ik}}{\inRoot{}}{\wedge}}{s_{b}}{\vee}$ and
$\aStore{}=\{(c,s_{c}),(s_{12} < s_{ik}, s_{12ik}),(s_{i} - s_{k},
s_{ik}),(k,s_{k})$ $,(b, s_{b}), (a,s_{a}),(i, s_{i}),(s_{1} + s_{2}, s_{12}),
(2,s_{2}), (1,s_{1})\}$.
