In order to construct a variational \ac{smt} solver we must first extend
\ac{vpl} to include non-Boolean values, we call the extended language \evpl{}
since its values can range over integers. \ac{vpl} included two kinds of
relations: relations such as $\neg$ and $\vee$ which required accumulation in
the presence of variation, and relations such as $\wedge$ which required no
special handling. Unfortunately, in the presence of variation there are no
relations such as $\wedge$ for the \ac{smt} theories. Thus we add support for
each theory except arrays through accumulation. Our strategy to extend \ac{vpl}
to \evpl{} is to add the appropriate cases to the syntax of \ac{vpl}, extend the
intermediate language, add the requisite primitive operations, and then extend
the inference rules of accumulation and choice removal.

The \evpl{} syntax is presented in \autoref{fig:arith:stx}. \evpl{} includes
syntax of the integer arithmetic extension, which consists of integer variables,
integer literals, a set of standard operators, and choices.
%
The sets of Boolean and arithmetic variables are disjoint, thus an expression
such as $(\kf{s < 10) \wedge (s \vee p})$, where $s$ occurs as both an integer
and Boolean variable is disallowed.
%
The syntax of the language prevents type errors and expressions that do not
yield Boolean values. For example, $\chc[D]{1,2} \wedge p$ is syntactically
invalid.
%
Similarly, the language only allows arithmetic expressions as children of an
inequality, for example: $\kf{g} = (\chc[A]{1, 2} + j \geq 2) \vee a \wedge
\chc[A]{c, d}$ is syntactically valid but $\pV{} \wedge{} (1 + 7 + 2 + 9)$ is
not.
%
Choices in the same dimension are synchronized across Boolean and arithmetic
sub-expressions, for example, the expression
%
$\kf{g} = (\chc[A]{1, 2} + j \geq 2) \vee (a \wedge \chc[A]{c,d})$
% %
represents two variants:
%
$\sem[\{(A, \true)\}]{g} = (1 + j \geq 2) \vee (a \wedge c)$ and
$\sem[\{(A, \false)\}]{g} = (2 + j \geq 2) \vee (a \wedge d)$.

Similarly to \autoref{chapter:vsat}, we define the assumed primitive operations
of the base solver in \autoref{fig:vsmt:primops}, and wrapped versions for new
operators in \autoref{fig:vsmt:primops:arithmetic} and
\autoref{fig:vsmt:primops:inequality}. The wrapped versions are defined
identically as the wrapped primitives in \autoref{fig:vsat:primwrapped} and
serve the same purpose.
%
From the perspective of the variational solver, operations such as addition,
division, and subtraction only differ in the primitive operation emitted to the
base solver. Thus, we define syntactic categories over like operations in
\autoref{fig:vsmt:categories}. Notice that the categories correspond to the
respective type of each operation. For example, the Boolean categories
encapsulate operations which take two Boolean expressions and return a Boolean
expression, similarly the inequality category encapsulate operators which take
numeric expressions and return Boolean expressions. Further \ac{smt} extensions
would directly copy this pattern, that is, defining a syntactic category of
\rn{FixedSizeBitVector} or \rn{Reals} operators. Similarly, while we present
only a single arithmetic unary function $-$, other arithmetic unary functions
would be straightforward to add. For example, to include an absolute value
operator $\kf{abs}$, one would define the wrapped primitive, and add the
operator to the appropriate syntactic category without requiring any
modification to the inference rules or intermediate languages.

Just as \ac{vpl} was extended, the intermediate language must be extended. First
we must add cases for inequality operations, and second we must define an
intermediate language for the arithmetic domain.
%
\autoref{fig:vsmt:il} defines the intermediate arithmetic language \eAR, and the
extended intermediate language \eIL. The syntax of both intermediate languages
follow directly from \evpl{} and should be unsurprising. The only important
difference from IL is that \eAR{} cannot express a \unit{} value. This is a
purposeful design decision; recall that a \unit{} represents a term that has
been sent to the base solver. Thus if \unit{} were in \eAR{} then expressions
such as $\unit{} + 2$ would be expressible in \eAR{}, however because all
arithmetic formula's require accumulation the only possible result of
evaluation/accumulation on arithmetic expressions is either a choice or a
symbolic term, not a \unit{}. Hence, we syntactically avoid classes of bugs by
omitting the \unit{} value in \eAR{}.
