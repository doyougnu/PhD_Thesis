In order to construct a variational \ac{smt} solver we must first extend
\ac{vpl} to include non-Boolean values. \ac{vpl} included two kinds of
relations: relations such as $\neg$ and $\vee$ which required accumulation in
the presence of variation, and relations such as $\wedge$ which required no
special handling. Unfortunately, in the presence of variation there are no
relations such as $\wedge$ for the \ac{smt} theories. Thus we add support for
each theory except arrays through accumulation. Our strategy to extend \ac{vpl}
to \evpl{} is to add the appropriate cases to the syntax of \ac{vpl}, add the
requisite primitive operations, and then extend the inference rules of
accumulation and choice removal.

The \evpl{} syntax is presented in \autoref{fig:arith:stx}. \evpl{} includes
syntax of the integer arithmetic extension, which consists of integer variables,
integer literals, a set of standard operators, and choices.
%
The sets of Boolean and arithmetic variables are disjoint, thus an expression
such as $(\kf{s < 10) \wedge (s \vee p})$, where $s$ occurs as both an integer
and Boolean variable is disallowed.
%
The syntax of the language prevents type errors and expressions that do not
yield Boolean values. For example, $\chc[D]{1,2} \wedge p$ is syntactically
invalid.
%
Thus, the language is purposefully limited to arithmetic expressions that
have an inequality at the root of the expression, such as: $\kf{g} =
(\chc[A]{1, 2} + j \geq 2) \vee a \wedge \chc[A]{c, d}$.
%
Choices in the same dimension are synchronized across Boolean and arithmetic
sub-expressions, for example, the expression
%
$\kf{g} = (\chc[A]{1, 2} + j \geq 2) \vee (a \wedge \chc[A]{c,d})$
% %
represents two variants:
%
$\sem[\{(A, \true)\}]{g} = (1 + j \geq 2) \vee (a \wedge c)$ and
$\sem[\{(A, \false)\}]{g} = (2 + j \geq 2) \vee (a \wedge d)$.

Similarly to \autoref{chapter:vsat}, we define the assumed primitive operations
of the base solver in \autoref{fig:vsmt:primops}, and wrapped versions in
\autoref{fig:vsmt:primwrapped}. The wrapped versions are defined exactly the
same and serve the same purpose as the wrapped primitives in
\autoref{fig:vsat:primwrapped}. Finally, from the perspective of the variational
solver, operations such as addition, division, and subtraction are identical
except for the primitive operation emitted to the base solver. Thus, we define
syntactic categories over like operations to simplify the inference rules of
accumulation, choice removal, and evaluation in
\autoref{fig:vsmt:primcategories}.
