The variational \ac{smt} version of accumulation is specified in
\autoref{fig:vsmt:inf:acc} and is a generalized variational fold over the
abstract syntax tree of \eIL{}. Just as before, accumulation is split into
congruence rules over the intermediate language, computation rules over symbolic
values and computation rules for references and choices.

The variational \ac{sat} version of accumulation is a specialized form of this
version of accumulation. The only semantic difference between operators is the
code emitted to the base solver, hence we generalize the previous version by
performing a lookup to retrieve the appropriate wrapped primitive. The primitive
is indicated with an \pwrap{underline}. For example, if $\boolFuncs{} = \wedge$
then \acBoolS{} specializes to \acAndS{} where $\pwrap{\boolFuncs{}} =
\pwrap{\pand}$, and thus the resulting call becomes $\pwrap{\pand}(\aStore{2},
s_1, s_2)$. Hence, the rules \acAndS{}, and \acOrS{} are specialized forms of
the general rule \acBoolS.

Similarly, we collapse the arithmetic and inequality computation rules to
\acArithS{} and \acInEqS{}. The semantics of each rule, besides the operator
lookup, remains unchanged; the congruence rules recur into the abstract syntax
tree to convert references to symbolic values, choices are skipped over due to
\acChc{} and \acChcI{}, and plain values are combined with the computation rules
\acBoolS, \acArithS, and \acInEqS.
%
The only other substantial difference is two new computation rules to handle
arithmetic choices and variables, \acChcI{}, and \acRefI{}. Both serve the same
function as their boolean counterparts \acChc{} and \acRef{}.

In this form it should be plain to see the recipe to further extend accumulation
to another background theory. One would add a new computation rules for the new
kinds of references and choices, a new computation rule for symbolic references
in the theory, and a new congruence rule over the new abstract syntax trees.
Extending accumulation with new operators is similarly trivial. Recall the
modulus example, to extend accumulation with a modulus operator, assuming the
wrapped primitive has been defined, we would only need to add the operator to
\integerFuncs{} syntactic category and create a case such that $\kf{mod} \in
\integerFuncs{}$ succeeds.
