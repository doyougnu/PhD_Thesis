A satisfiability solver is a software system that solves the Boolean
Satisfiability Problem. One of the oldest problems in computer
science\footnote{see~\citet{BBH+09} for a complete history from the ancients,
  through to George Boole to the modern day.} and famously
NP-Complete~\cite{10.1145/800157.805047}, the Boolean satisfiability problem is
the problem of checking if a formula in propositional logic has an assignment of
Boolean values to variables, such that under substitution the formula evaluates
to \tru{}. We formalize the problem and terms in the following definitions:

\begin{definition}[Model]
  Given a formula in propositional logic, $\kf{f}$, which contains a set of
  Boolean variables $\kf{vs}$. A model, $\kf{m}$, is a set of assignments of
  Boolean values to variables in $\kf{f}$ such that $\kf{f}$ evaluates to
  \tru{}, \ie{}, $\kf{m = \{ (v \rightarrow{} b)\ |\ v \in vs, b \in
    \booleans} \}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Satisfiable]
  Given a formula in propositional logic, $\kf{f}$, which contains a set of
  Boolean variables $v$. If there exists an assignment of variables to Boolean
  values such that $\kf{f}$ evaluates to \tru{}, then we say $\kf{f}$ is
  \emph{satisfiable}.
\end{definition}

For example, we can show that the formula $\kf{good = a \wedge b \vee c}$ is
satisfiable with the model: $\{\kf{(a \rightarrow{} \tru{}), (b \rightarrow{}
  \tru{}), (c \rightarrow{} \fls{})}\}$. However, a formula such as $\kf{bad =
  (a \vee b) \wedge \fls{}}$ is not satisfiable as no assignment to the
variables $\kf{a}$ and $\kf{b}$ would allow $\kf{bad}$ evaluate to \tru{}.

\begin{definition}[Boolean Satisfiability Problem]
  Given a formula in propositional logic, $\kf{f}$, determine if $\kf{f}$ is
  satisfiable.
\end{definition}
