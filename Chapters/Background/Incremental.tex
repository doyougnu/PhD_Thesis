Suppose, we have three related propositional formulas that we want to solve.
%
\begin{align*}
  p =\ a \wedge b \wedge c \wedge e && q=\ a \wedge (b \vee \neg \iV{}) \wedge c \wedge (\gV{} \rightarrow c) && r =~z \leftrightarrow (a \wedge b \wedge c \wedge e)
\end{align*}
%
\pV{} is simply a conjunction of variables. In \qV{}, relative to \pV{}, we can
see that two variables are added, \iV{}, \gV{}, one variable is removed \eV{},
and and there are two new clauses: $(b \vee \neg \iV{})$ and $(\gV{} \rightarrow
c)$, both of which possibly affect the values of \bV{} and \cV{}. In \rV{}, the
variables and constraints introduced in \pV{} are further constrained to a new
variable, \zV{}.

Suppose one wants to find a satisfying assignment for each formula. Using a
classic \ac{sat} solver results in the procedure illustrated in
\autoref{fig:bkg:bf}; where \ac{sat} solving is a batch process and no information
is reused. Alternatively, a procedure using an incremental \ac{sat} solver is
illustrated in \autoref{fig:bkg:inc}; in this scenario, all of the formulas are
solved by single solver instance where terms are programmatically added and
removed from the solver throughout the process. The ability to add and remove
terms from the solvers is enabled by a data structure within the incremental
\ac{sat} solver called an \textit{assertion stack}. The assertion stack is a stack
of declarations, definitions, or formulas that determine the \textit{context} of
the solver. A solver context is the union of all global variable definitions and
everything on the assertion stack. A program may add an assertion to the stack
via the \texttt{push} operation and remove from the top via a \texttt{pop}
operation~\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-09284-3_16}. A call to
\texttt{resetAssertionStack} pops everything on the stack.

In an efficient process one would initially add as many \emph{shared} terms as
possible; \pV{} in this example. Then check for satisfiability, request a model,
and manipulate the assertion stack to reach the next problem of interest; \qV{}
in this case. Notice that to reach the next problem, \qV{}, from \pV{}, several
operations are required: \eV{} and \cV{} must be removed, \bV{} must be updated,
and the new clauses must be introduced. To reach \rV{} from \qV{} all assertions
would need to be popped to add \zV{}, then re-pushed.
