~\label{chapter:background}

This section provides background on \ac{sat} and incremental \ac{sat} solving.
It is intended as a general introduction to these concepts. Specific techniques
or algorithms are not discussed in detail. All descriptions follow the
SMT-LIB2~\cite{BarFT-SMTLIB} standard and describe incremental solvers as a
black box eliding internal details of any specific solver which adheres to the
standard.
