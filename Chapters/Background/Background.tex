\label{chapter:background}
%
This section provides background on \ac{sat} and incremental \ac{sat} solving,
and assumes knowledge of propositional logic. It is intended as an introduction
to these concepts for a general audience. Specific techniques or algorithms
behind satisfiability solvers are not discussed in detail. All descriptions
follow \acl{smtlib}~\cite{BarFT-SMTLIB}, the standardized language for
interacting with \ac{sat} solvers, and describe incremental solvers as a black
box. Following the notation from the many-valued logic
community~\cite{Rescher1969-RESML} we refer to propositional logic as \pl{},
which denotes a two-valued logic.
