One of the most important aspects of any programming language is the ability to
control complexity, especially as software written in that language grows. The
burgeoning field of \emph{variation theory} and \emph{variational
  programming}~\cite{EW11gttse,EW11tosem,HW16fosd,CEW16ecoop,Walk14onward}
attempt to control complexity which is induced into software when many
\emph{similar yet distinct} kinds of software must coexist. For example, the
same piece of software is often \emph{ported} to other platforms, creating
similar, yet distinct instances of that software which must be maintained. Such
instances of variation are ubiquitous: Web applications are tested on multiple
servers; programming languages maintain backwards compatibility and so do
software libraries; databases evolve over time, local and data; and device
drivers must work with varying processors and architectures. Variation theory
and variational programming has been successful in small systems\todo{cite}, yet
it has not been tested in a performance demanding practical domain. In the words
of Joe Armstrong\cite{armstrongThesis}, ``No theory is complete without proof
that the ideas work in practice''; this is the central project of this thesis,
to put the ideas of \emph{variation} and \emph{variational programming}to the
test in the practical domain of \ac{sat}.

The major contribution of the thesis is the formalization of a \emph{\ac{vpl}},
\emph{variational \acl{sat}}, and the construction of a \emph{variational
  \ac{sat} solver}. The thesis makes several other contributions. It extends
variational \acl{sat} to variational \ac{smt}. It demonstrates reusable
techniques and architecture for constructing \emph{variational or
  variation-aware} systems in other domains using the non-variational
counterparts of these systems. It shows that, with the concept of variation, the
variational \ac{smt} and \ac{sat} solvers can be trivially parallelized. Lastly,
the thesis provides a general algorithm to construct variational strings from a
set of non-variational strings and argues for the proliferation of variation
theory to other domains in computer science.
