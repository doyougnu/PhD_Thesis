We have formalized variational \ac{smt} and \ac{sat} solving. However, we have
yet to investigate the performance of our methods. Recall from
\autoref{chapter:introduction} that one of our motivating reasons for this
project was the idea that if we only compute shared terms once, then we should
observe a speedup in runtime performance when solving sets of related ac{sat}
problems. In this chapter, we investigate and verify these claims.

Assessing the performance of \ac{sat} and \ac{smt} solvers is notoriously
difficult~\cite{Gent94thesat} because it highly depends on the input to the
\ac{sat} or \ac{smt} solver. The issue is related to the hardness of the input
problem, where hardness is a ratio of clauses in the \ac{sat} or \ac{smt}
problem to the number of variables. If we have many clauses and not many
variables then the problem is over-constrained and it is easy to show
\rn{unsat}, however if there are not many clauses but many variables then the
problem is under-constrained and it is easy to show \rn{sat}.
