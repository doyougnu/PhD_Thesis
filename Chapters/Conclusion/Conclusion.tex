% \ac{sat} and \ac{smt} solvers are ubiquitous and powerful tools in computer
% science and software engineering. Incremental \ac{sat} and \ac{smt} provide an
% interface that supports solving many related problems efficiently. However, the
% interface could be automated and improved.

% The goal of this thesis is to explore the design and architecture of a
% variational satisfiability solver that automates and improves on the incremental
% \ac{sat} interface. Through the application of the choice calculus the interface
% can be automated for satisfiability problems, the solver interaction can be
% formalized and made asynchronous, and the solver is able to directly express
% variation in a problem domain.

% The thesis will present a complete approach to variational satisfiability and
% satisfiability modulo theory solving based on incremental solving. It will
% include a method to automatically encode a set of Boolean formulae into a
% variational propositional formula. A method for detecting the difficulty of
% solving such a variational propositional formula. A data set suitable for future
% research in the \ac{sat}, \ac{spl} and variation research communities. A
% variational satisfiability solver, an asynchronous variational satisfiable
% modulo theory solver and a proof of variational preservation.
