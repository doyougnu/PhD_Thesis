This thesis has presented variational satisfiability and satisfiability-modulo
theory solving. In \autoref{chapter:introduction} we defined the success of this
thesis as applying the concept of variation in the domain of satisfiability
solving to create a variational satisfiability solver. The solver must
explicitly express the concept of variation in a user-facing language and must
be performent with respect to the performance of plain satisfiability solvers.
By this definition we have succeeded in demonstrating these ideas work in
practice in the domain of satisfiability solving. We have not only shown that
through the application of the choice calculus variation can be directly
expressed by the end-user, but also that runtime performance may be improved
because local points of variation are made explicit.

To conclude the thesis we review the important contributions in
\autoref{section:conclusion:cont-summary}.
\autoref{section:conclusion:future-work} provides immediate directions for
future work.

% \ac{sat} and \ac{smt} solvers are ubiquitous and powerful tools in computer
% science and software engineering. Incremental \ac{sat} and \ac{smt} provide an
% interface that supports solving many related problems efficiently. However, the
% interface could be automated and improved.

% The goal of this thesis is to explore the design and architecture of a
% variational satisfiability solver that automates and improves on the incremental
% \ac{sat} interface. Through the application of the choice calculus the interface
% can be automated for satisfiability problems, the solver interaction can be
% formalized and made asynchronous, and the solver is able to directly express
% variation in a problem domain.

% The thesis will present a complete approach to variational satisfiability and
% satisfiability modulo theory solving based on incremental solving. It will
% include a method to automatically encode a set of Boolean formulae into a
% variational propositional formula. A method for detecting the difficulty of
% solving such a variational propositional formula. A data set suitable for future
% research in the \ac{sat}, \ac{spl} and variation research communities. A
% variational satisfiability solver, an asynchronous variational satisfiable
% modulo theory solver and a proof of variational preservation.
