Variational \ac{sat} solving is the latest in a line of work that uses the
choice calculus to investigate variation as a computational phenomena. The
choice calculus has been successfully applied to diverse areas of computer
science, such as databases~\citep{ATW17dbpl,ATW18poly},
graphics~\citep{ES18diagrams}, data
structures~\citep{MMWWK17vamos,Walk14onward,SE17fosd,EWC13fosd}, type
systems~\citep{CCEW18popl,CCW18icfp,CEW:TOPLAS14,CEW12icfp}, error
messages~\citep{CES17jvlc,CE14popl,CEW12icfp,CES14hcc}, variational execution
systems~\citep{10.1145/3276487,M14} and now satisfiability solving.
