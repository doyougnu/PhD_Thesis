We have succeeded in creating a variation-aware \ac{sat} and \ac{smt} solver by
utilizing plain \ac{sat} and \ac{smt} solvers. This chapter situates this work
in the larger research context. \autoref{section:related-work:similar-solvers}
discusses other satisfiability solvers that reuse information and provides a
small history of incremental \ac{sat} solving.
\autoref{section:related-work:applications} discusses possible applications for
the variational solver.
\autoref{section:related-work:reasoning-about-variability} discusses other
methods to reason about variability in software product-lines and situates this
work in that domain. Lastly, \autoref{section:related-work:variational-systems}
compares our approach to other variation-aware systems that have been invented
over the last decade.
