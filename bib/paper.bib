 abstract = {This paper presents a simple and widely applicable multiple test procedure of the sequentially rejective type, i.e. hypotheses are rejected one at a time until no further rejections can be done. It is shown that the test has a prescribed level of significance protection against error of the first kind for any combination of true hypotheses. The power properties of the test and a number of possible applications are also discussed.},

A joint project of NYU and U Iowa, CVC4 aims to support the useful feature set of CVC3 and SMT-LIBv2 while optimizing the design of the core system architecture and decision procedures to take advantage of recent engineering and algorithmic advances. CVC4 represents a completely new code base; it is a from-scratch rewrite of CVC3, and many subsystems have been completely redesigned. Additional decision procedures for CVC4 are currently under development, but for what it currently achieves, it is a lighter-weight and higher-performing tool than CVC3. We describe the system architecture, subsystems of note, and discuss some applications and continuing work.",

abstract = {Feature Models are a mechanism to organize the configuration space and facilitate the construction of software variants by describing configuration options using features, i.e., a name representing a functionality. The development of Feature Models is an error prone activity and detecting their anomalies is a challenging and important task needed to promote their usage. Feature Models have been extended with context to capture the correlation of configuration options with contextual influences and user customizations. Unfortunately, this extension makes the task of detecting anomalies harder. In this paper, we formalize the anomaly analysis in Context-aware Feature Models and we show how Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) solvers can be used to detect anomalies without relying on iterative calls to a SAT solver. By extending the reconfigurator engine HyVarRec, we present findings evidencing that QBF solvers can outperform the common techniques for anomaly analysis on some instances.},
